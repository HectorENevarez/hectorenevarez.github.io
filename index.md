**Hello!** My name is Hector and I am currently a third year student studying computer science at San Diego State University. I enjoy learning and I have found that the best way to learn something new is by teaching it. I apply this principle by giving weekly workshops through [SDSU's AI Club](https://aiclub.sdsu.edu/). Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or a random interesting fact. <br>

I am currently looking for a software engineering internship for the summer of 2021. I have strong Python programming abilites and a strong foundation in machine learning. Take a quick look at [my resume](#) for a full breakdown of my skills. If you have any questions you can always contact me through email at <hnevarez1285@sdsu.edu>.

## Highlights
In this section I am showcasing some of my favorite projects that I have worked on.

#### [Covid-19 Risk Detection](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/Covid-Risk-Detection)

This application aims to identify whether people in a certain location are following the proper Covid-19 guidelines. Each individual person is tracked and their unique information is stored while they are in frame. The application tracks to see whether everyone is properly social distancing and wearing a face mask. To identify if they are wearing a face mask, a model, trained on 5,000 images I collected, classifies whether the person is wearing a mask or not. For the social distancing, the euclidean distance from each persons centroid marks if two persons are too close together.
