title: About Me
---

**Hello!** My name is Hector and I am currently a third year student studying computer science at San Diego State University. I enjoy learning and I have found that the best way to learn something new is by teaching it. I apply this principle by giving weekly workshops through [SDSU's AI Club](https://aiclub.sdsu.edu/). Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or a random interesting fact. <br>

I am currently looking for a software engineering internship for the summer of 2021. I have strong Python programming abilites and a strong foundation in machine learning. Take a quick look at [my resume](#) for a full breakdown of my skills. If you have any questions you can always contact me through email at <hnevarez1285@sdsu.edu>.

# Highlights
In this section I am showcasing some of my favorite projects that I have worked on.

#### [Covid-19 Risk Detection](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/Covid-Risk-Detection)

This application aims to identify whether people in a certain location are following the proper Covid-19 guidelines. Each individual person is tracked and their unique information is stored while they are in frame. The application tracks to see whether everyone is properly social distancing and wearing a face mask. To identify if they are wearing a face mask, a model, trained on 5,000 images I collected, classifies whether the person is wearing a mask or not with 91% accuracy. For the social distancing, the euclidean distance from each persons centroid marks if two persons are too close together.

#### [AI Club Workshops](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/AIClubWorkshopsFall20/)
This series of workshops aims to introduce the SDSU's AI Club members to foundational topics in AI regardless of skill level. The 10-week long workshops start off with a simple introduction to python programming. The Python workshops introduce members to syntax, data types, functions, and data structures. From there the next few workshops deal with data science. This portion goes over three major steps of the data science process; collecting and cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning models with the data. This series of workshops introduces key python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn. The next series of workshops go over computer vision. It starts off by performing object tracking and object segmentation using opencv. Later we dive into more advance topics such as using neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify images using the MNIST dataset.
